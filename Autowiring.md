Autowiring in Spring
Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly. It internally uses setter or constructor injection.

Autowiring can't be used to inject primitive and string values. It works with reference only.

Advantage of Autowiring
It requires the less code because we don't need to write the code to inject the dependency explicitly.

Disadvantage of Autowiring
No control of programmer.
