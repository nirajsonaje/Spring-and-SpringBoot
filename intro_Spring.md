- Spring is a lightweight framework. 
- It can be thought of as a framework of frameworks because it provides support to various frameworks such as Struts, Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, etc.
- The framework, in broader sense, can be defined as a structure where we find solution of the various technical problems.
- The Spring framework comprises several modules such as IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, ORM, WEB MVC etc. 
- Inversion Of Control (IOC) and Dependency Injection
- These are the design patterns that are used to remove dependency from the programming code. They make the code easier to test and maintain.
- IOC makes the code loosely coupled. In such case, there is no need to modify the code if our logic is moved to new environment.

In Spring framework, IOC container is responsible to inject the dependency. We provide metadata to the IOC container either by XML file or annotation.

Advantage of Dependency Injection
- makes the code loosely coupled so easy to maintain
- makes the code easy to test

Advantages of Spring Framework
There are many advantages of Spring Framework. They are as follows:

1) Predefined Templates
Spring framework provides templates for JDBC, Hibernate, JPA etc. technologies. So there is no need to write too much code. It hides the basic steps of these technologies.

Let's take the example of JdbcTemplate, you don't need to write the code for exception handling, creating connection, creating statement, committing transaction, closing connection etc. You need to write the code of executing query only. Thus, it save a lot of JDBC code.

2) Loose Coupling
The Spring applications are loosely coupled because of dependency injection.

3) Easy to test
The Dependency Injection makes easier to test the application. The EJB or Struts application require server to run the application but Spring framework doesn't require server.

4) Lightweight
Spring framework is lightweight because of its POJO implementation. The Spring Framework doesn't force the programmer to inherit any class or implement any interface. That is why it is said non-invasive.

5) Fast Development
The Dependency Injection feature of Spring Framework and it support to various frameworks makes the easy development of JavaEE application.

6) Powerful abstraction
It provides powerful abstraction to JavaEE specifications such as JMS, JDBC, JPA and JTA.

7) Declarative support
It provides declarative support for caching, validation, transactions and formatting.

Test
This layer provides support of testing with JUnit and TestNG.

Spring Core Container
The Spring Core container contains core, beans, context and expression language (EL) modules.

Core and Beans
These modules provide IOC and Dependency Injection features.

Context
This module supports internationalization (I18N), EJB, JMS, Basic Remoting.

Expression Language
It is an extension to the EL defined in JSP. It provides support to setting and getting property values, method invocation, accessing collections and indexers, named variables, logical and arithmetic operators, retrieval of objects by name etc.

AOP, Aspects and Instrumentation
These modules support aspect oriented programming implementation where you can use Advices, Pointcuts etc. to decouple the code.

The aspects module provides support to integration with AspectJ.

The instrumentation module provides support to class instrumentation and classloader implementations.

Data Access / Integration
This group comprises of JDBC, ORM, OXM, JMS and Transaction modules. These modules basically provide support to interact with the database.

Web
This group comprises of Web, Web-Servlet, Web-Struts and Web-Portlet. These modules provide support to create web application.


What is a Spring configuration file?
A Spring configuration file is an XML file. This file mainly contains the classes information. It describes how those classes are configured as well as introduced to each other. The XML configuration files, however, are verbose and more clean. If itâ€™s not planned and written correctly, it becomes very difficult to manage in big projects.


 What are the different components of a Spring application?
A Spring application, generally consists of following components:

Interface: It defines the functions.
Bean class: It contains properties, its setter and getter methods, functions etc.
Spring Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP): Provides the functionality of cross-cutting concerns.
Bean Configuration File: Contains the information of classes and how to configure them.
User program: It uses the function.

How many types of IOC containers are there in spring?
BeanFactory: BeanFactory is like a factory class that contains a collection of beans. It instantiates the bean whenever asked for by clients.
ApplicationContext: The ApplicationContext interface is built on top of the BeanFactory interface. It provides some extra functionality on top BeanFactory.

- What do you understand by @Autowired annotation?
The @Autowired annotation provides more accurate control over where and how autowiring should be done. This annotation is used to autowire bean on the setter methods, constructor, a property or methods with arbitrary names or multiple arguments. By default, it is a type driven injection.

For Example:

public class Employee
{
private String name;
@Autowired
public void setName(String name)
{this.name=name; }
public string getName()
{ return name; }
}
